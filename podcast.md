Since 2015, I spend short of two hours each day commuting to work and back (train + bike). Listening to podcasts and audiobook have since become part of my daily routine and my main source of knowledge about topics outside my field of research. I find podcasts large bandwidth means of scholarly communication. Since 2017, I have started producing some podcasts of my own. I am for always indebted to [Lex Bohlmeijer](https://twitter.com/lexbohlmeijer) for his outstanding [Goede Gespreken(nl)](https://soundcloud.com/de-correspondent) and kindly giving me some crucial advice and encouragement for the start.

### Podcasts I produce

#### The Road to Open Science
When the open-science taskforce was formed at the Utrecht University to come up with a plan to promote open science practices, I was invited to represent the [Utrecht Young Academy](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/utrecht-young-academy). We soon mentioned some resistance for a wider embrace of such practices, including fear, misinformation, and persisting old culture. This motivated some of us at the Utrecht Young Academy to start the [Road to Open Science](https://twitter.com/R2OSpodcast) podcast together with our colleagues at the university library and the [Open Science Community Utrecht](http://www.openscience-utrecht.com). Our main goal was to communicate the basic principles of open science and engage in (sometimes difficult) discussions such as credit, culture, and vested interests.
