### Regular courses
#### Nature of Matter
This course covers main topics of solid state physics for the third year bachelor of physics. As part of this course, students are required to play with instructive jupyter notebooks and write some of their own. We collect these notebooks in the [More Is Different repository](https://github.com/SanliFaez/MoreIsDifferent) and welcome other students and teachers to use them and also contribute.

#### Bachelor Research Internship
This course gives the second year bachelor students the opportunity of engaging in a research project and get some first hand experience on day to day activities in an experimental group.

### Project supervision
In [our lab](https://nanoepics.github.io), we regularly define experimental projects for bachelor and master students. Contact me if you are interested in choosing a very cool experimental project. 

Completed projects under my (co)supervision include:
* Qianjing Tang, _Developing fluorescence microscopy setup to study microscopic solute transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media using microfluidics_ (joint project with the Faculty of Geosciences)
* Milo Collaris, Crystallizing ultrasonically levitated colloidal droplets
* Lorenzo Sierra Perez, _Relation between surface charge and the flow rate within microfluidic channels_
* Zeyu Kuang,_Measuring Absolute Scattering Cross-sections of nanoparticles and single molecules_ __(winner best presentation 2017)__
* Tom Niessen,_Feedback control: theoretical and experimental research using a keysight DAQ_
* Suzan Marsman,_Wavefront-shaping demonstration setup_ __(winner best presentation 2016)__
* Kevin Namink,_Do-It-Yourself microscope_
