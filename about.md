title: About me
---

I am an assistant professor (tenured) at the [Physics department](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-physics) of Utrecht University. I am also a member of [Utrecht Young Academy](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/utrecht-young-academy), member of KNAW [De Jonge Akademie](https://www.dejongeakademie.nl/) and a fellow at the [Center for Unusual Collaborations](https://www.unusualcollaborations.com/).

I studied Physics at the Sharif University of Technology in Iran, and recieved my master's degree in Nanotechnology from University of Twente. My doctorate degree from the Univesity of Amsterdam was based on research on wave propagation in strongly scattering media and Anderson localization. My post-doctoral research at the [Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light ](http://www.mpl.mpg.de/en/sandoghdar/) and [Leiden Institute of Physics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/physics/biological-matter/orrit-lab-folder) was focused on single-molecule optics and (cryogenic) microscopy.

Since 2015, I am the principal investigator for the research direction [nanoElectroPhotonics](http://www.nano-epics.com) at the [Nanophotonics section](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nanophotonics) of the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials at Utrecht University.

Next to my research activities, I [make podcasts](https://sanlifaez.github.io/podcast/), and serve on the board of the [KlimaatHelpdesk](http://www.klimaathelpdesk.org/) foundation..
