title: About me
---

I am an academic technologist.

## Open hardware

In my research, I use open source for making more accessible and reproducible scientific equipment. Check the [nanoEPics website](https://nanoepics.github.io/) to learn more about my research and the [Lili's ProtoLab](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/lilis-proto-lab) to get started with prototyping. 

## Climate Action

My interdisciplinary work is dedicated to climate action from a system's perspective. I am the Open Science Lead at the [Netherlands Climate Research Initiative](https://hetkin.nl/).
Previously, I have been a founding board member for the [Climate Helpdesk](https://www.klimaathelpdesk.org/).â€‹

## Science Policy

As a board member of the [Young Academy](https://dejongeakademie.nl/default.aspx) of KNAW, I advocate for a more inclusive academic system and better conditions for early career researchers. 

My rebellion is to set a stronger innovation policy for the common good.  

## Academic role
I am a associate professor (part-time ) at the [Physics department](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-physics) of Utrecht University. I am also a board-member of KNAW [De Jonge Akademie](https://www.dejongeakademie.nl/) and a fellow at the [Center for Unusual Collaborations](https://www.unusualcollaborations.com/).

Next to my research activities, I sometimes [make podcasts](https://sanlifaez.github.io/podcast/).
